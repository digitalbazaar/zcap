    /* Note: Trust begins at the root zcap, so we start chain validation at
    the root and move forward toward the tail from there. This also helps
    prevent an attacker from wasting time when they submit long zcap chains
    that are extensions of otherwise valid chains.

    So, each parent zcap must be verified before its child is. This also means
    that we can't simply recursively unwind the chain in reverse; therefore,
    the code is a bit more complex.

    Note that if a chain is being checked without an invocation, i.e., without
    invoking the tail capability, then the tail's capability delegation *proof*
    will have been cryptographically verified prior to this call. Otherwise,
    it will need to be cryptographically verified. There is a signal described
    below to indicate whether this verification needs to occur. Regardless, the
    tail has not yet been validated as a tail for the chain and won't be until
    the rest of the chain, starting at the root, is validated.

    The validation process is:

    0. Run a short-circuit check to ensure that we only verify the capability
      chain once; that is, we only start checking the chain when we haven't
      verified any parent zcaps yet. Whether we've started checking the chain
      yet or not is handled by a derived class that implements
      `_shortCircuitValidate`, returning the short-circuit validation result
      if the chain check has already started and `undefined` if it hasn't.
    1. If we haven't been short-circuited, then dereference the capability
      chain referenced in the tail proof to get all zcaps in the chain.
    2. Run any proof-purpose specific checks prior to checking the rest of
      the chain. This allows shortcuts when checking a capability invocation
      proof, e.g., if an invocation is immediately invalid for some reason,
      there is no need to check that the delegation rules were followed along
      the entire chain. This method also returns the `capabilityChainMeta`
      array to use to hold the capability delegation proof verify results. If
      a capability delegation proof for the tail has already been verified,
      this array will have a placeholder for its full proof validation result
      as a signal to avoid duplicating this work later.
    3. Verify the chain from root => tail by calling `verifyCapabilityChain`
      just once -- when validating the tail. The short-circuit check above
      ensures we don't call this more than once. Additionally, the
      `capabilityChainMeta` array signals whether we need to cryptographically
      verify the capability delegation proof on the tail or if we must skip
      this to avoid duplicating that work.
    4. Run any purpose-specific checks after chain verification. This allows
      capability delegation proof checks to be run on the tail against the now
      verified parent, allowing its proof validation result to be fully
      constructed and updated in the `capabilityChainMeta` array (as well
      as the return value for this function).
    5. Run the `inspectCapabilityChain` hook, if given, to allow for custom
      implementations to check for revoked zcaps in databases or whatever other
      behavior is desired. */
